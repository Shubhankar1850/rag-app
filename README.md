## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
         cd <repo-name>
            ```

            2. **Install dependencies**
               ```bash
                  npm install
                     # or
                        yarn install
                           ```

                           3. **Set up environment variables**  
                              Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and include the following:
                                 ```bash
                                    GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=<your-gcp-project-id>
                                       GOOGLE_VERTEX_AI_KEY=<your-api-key>
                                          VECTOR_DB_URL=<your-vector-db-url>
                                             VECTOR_DB_KEY=<your-vector-db-key>
                                                ```

                                                4. **Run the application locally**
                                                   ```bash
                                                      npm run dev
                                                         ```

                                                         5. Access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
